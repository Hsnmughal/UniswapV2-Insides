## Swap Math

### Basic Swap Formula
Calculates output token amount (dy) when swapping input tokens (dx) in a constant product AMM.

**Final Equation:** `dy = (Y‚ÇÄ * dx) / (X‚ÇÄ + dx)`

**Derivation:**
1. Initial pool state: X‚ÇÄ and Y‚ÇÄ tokens
2. After swap: (X‚ÇÄ + dx) and (Y‚ÇÄ - dy)
3. Constant product invariant: X‚ÇÄ * Y‚ÇÄ = (X‚ÇÄ + dx) * (Y‚ÇÄ - dy)
4. Solving for dy: X‚ÇÄ * Y‚ÇÄ = (X‚ÇÄ + dx) * (Y‚ÇÄ - dy)
5. Y‚ÇÄ - dy = (X‚ÇÄ * Y‚ÇÄ) / (X‚ÇÄ + dx)
6. dy = Y‚ÇÄ - (X‚ÇÄ * Y‚ÇÄ) / (X‚ÇÄ + dx) = (Y‚ÇÄ * dx) / (X‚ÇÄ + dx)

## Swap Fee Calculation

Accounts for the trading fee when calculating output amounts.

**Final Equation with Fees:** `dy = dx(1-F) * Y‚ÇÄ / (X‚ÇÄ + dx(1-F))`

Where:
- dx = Input amount of token X
- dy = Output amount of token Y
- X‚ÇÄ = Amount of token X in pool
- Y‚ÇÄ = Amount of token Y in pool
- F = Fee rate (0.003 or 0.3% in Uniswap V2)

**Key Insight:**
- Fee is calculated as: `swap fee = F * dx`
- Only `dx(1-F)` of the input amount participates in the swap

**Example:**
In a pool with 6,000,000 DAI and 3,000 ETH, swapping 1,000 DAI yields approximately 0.498341 ETH after the 0.3% fee.

## Liquidity Operations

### Adding Liquidity

To add liquidity without price impact, tokens must be added in the same proportion as they exist in the pool.

**Final Equation:** `dy/dx = Y‚ÇÄ/X‚ÇÄ`

**Derivation:**
1. Current price ratio: `Price = Y‚ÇÄ/X‚ÇÄ`
2. To maintain the same price: `(Y‚ÇÄ + dy)/(X‚ÇÄ + dx) = Y‚ÇÄ/X‚ÇÄ`
3. Cross-multiplying: `X‚ÇÄ(Y‚ÇÄ + dy) = Y‚ÇÄ(X‚ÇÄ + dx)`
4. Expanding: `X‚ÇÄY‚ÇÄ + X‚ÇÄdy = Y‚ÇÄX‚ÇÄ + Y‚ÇÄdx`
5. Simplifying: `X‚ÇÄdy = Y‚ÇÄdx`
6. Therefore: `dy/dx = Y‚ÇÄ/X‚ÇÄ`

### Pool Shares Minting

Calculates LP tokens to mint when adding liquidity.

**Final Equation:** `S = (L‚ÇÅ - L‚ÇÄ)/L‚ÇÄ * T = (dx/X‚ÇÄ) * T = (dy/Y‚ÇÄ) * T`

Where:
- S = Shares to mint
- T = Total existing shares
- L‚ÇÅ = Liquidity after adding tokens
- L‚ÇÄ = Liquidity before adding tokens

**Derivation:**
1. The ratio of new to old shares equals the ratio of new to old pool value: `(T + S)/T = L‚ÇÅ/L‚ÇÄ`
2. Solving for S: `S = T * (L‚ÇÅ - L‚ÇÄ)/L‚ÇÄ`
3. The relative increase in liquidity equals the relative amount of tokens added: `(L‚ÇÅ - L‚ÇÄ)/L‚ÇÄ = dx/X‚ÇÄ = dy/Y‚ÇÄ`

### Removing Liquidity

Calculates token amounts to withdraw when burning LP tokens.

**Final Equations:**
- `DX = X‚ÇÄ * S/T`
- `DY = Y‚ÇÄ * S/T`

Where:
- DX, DY = Amounts of tokens X and Y to withdraw
- S = Shares being burned
- T = Total shares outstanding
- X‚ÇÄ, Y‚ÇÄ = Token amounts in the pool

**Derivation:**
1. The decrease in liquidity is proportional to shares burned: `(L‚ÇÄ - L‚ÇÅ)/L‚ÇÄ = S/T`
2. This equals the proportional decrease in each token: `S/T = DX/X‚ÇÄ = DY/Y‚ÇÄ`

**Key Principle:**
When removing liquidity, the price ratio must remain unchanged: `dy/dx = Y‚ÇÄ/X‚ÇÄ`

This can be derived by setting the price before equal to the price after: `(Y‚ÇÄ - dy)/(X‚ÇÄ - dx) = Y‚ÇÄ/X‚ÇÄ`

### Pool Shares Burning

Calculates the overall value withdrawn when burning LP tokens.

**Final Equation:** `L‚ÇÄ - L‚ÇÅ = (S/T) * L‚ÇÄ`

**Derivation:**
1. The ratio of remaining to original shares equals the ratio of remaining to original liquidity: `(T - S)/T = L‚ÇÅ/L‚ÇÄ`
2. Solving for withdrawn value: `L‚ÇÄ - L‚ÇÅ = L‚ÇÄ - L‚ÇÄ * (T - S)/T = L‚ÇÄ * [1 - (T - S)/T] = L‚ÇÄ * [S/T]`

## Flash Swap Mechanics

Calculates the minimum fee required for flash swaps.

**Final Equation:** `fee ‚â• (0.003/0.997) * dx‚ÇÄ`

Where:
- dx‚ÇÄ = Amount borrowed
- fee = Additional amount to repay

**Derivation:**
1. Pool constraint: `x‚ÇÄ - dx‚ÇÄ + 0.997 dx‚ÇÅ ‚â• x‚ÇÄ`
2. Repayment relationship: `dx‚ÇÅ = dx‚ÇÄ + fee`
3. Simplifying: `-dx‚ÇÄ + 0.997 dx‚ÇÅ ‚â• 0`
4. Substituting: `0.997(dx‚ÇÄ + fee) ‚â• dx‚ÇÄ`
5. Solving for fee: `0.997 fee ‚â• 0.003 dx‚ÇÄ`
6. Therefore: `fee ‚â• (0.003/0.997) * dx‚ÇÄ`

## TWAP Calculation

Calculates Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) efficiently using cumulative price.

**Final Equation:** `TWAP from t_k to t_n = (C_n - C_k) / (t_n - t_k)`

Where:
- C_j = Cumulative price at time j
- t_k, t_n = Start and end times for the TWAP calculation

**Derivation:**
1. Define cumulative price: `C_j = Œ£(i=0 to j-1) Œît_i √ó p_i`
   - This is the sum of price √ó duration products up to time j
2. The sum of price changes from t_k to t_n equals `(C_n - C_k)`
3. Dividing by the time period gives the time-weighted average

**Implementation Advantage:**
This approach only requires storing a single cumulative price state variable that updates with each price change, making TWAP calculations gas-efficient and practical for on-chain implementation.
